## 3. Install
Download a code and unpack it into your project folder. Use Thonny IDE or other IDE for upload your code in microcontroller board.

## 4. Quick start
#### Typical Wi-Fi connection code for ESP board

import network, urequests

wlan_id = 'Mikro2'
wlan_pass = '196613036594'

phone_number = '380673820543'
api_key = '92941499'

def connect(ssid, passwd):
    wlan.disconnect()
    wlan.connect(ssid, passwd)
    while not wlan.isconnected():
        pass
    return wlan.ifconfig()
